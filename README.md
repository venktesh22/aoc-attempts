# Advent of Code Progress Tracker

This repository tracks my progress as I solve puzzles from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) from 2015 to 2024 and beyond. Each puzzle has two parts, and I'll mark them as `✅` when solved or `❌` otherwise. I'll also add notes for interesting learnings or challenges faced during the process.
